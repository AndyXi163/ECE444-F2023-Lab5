# ECE444-F2023-Lab5
This is the GitHub repository used for the completion of ECE444 Lab 5.

It is largely based on the tutorial at https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd , excluding the parts involving Heroku.

Notice that removing flaskr.db and running python create_db.py should be performed every time after committing and pushing code.
